# Image Assignment Review

## How You Can Help Fix Image Assignments

I need your help to identify which images are incorrectly assigned. Here's how:

### Option 1: Tell Me What's Wrong (Easiest)

Just tell me which sections have wrong images. For example:
- "Day 6 (American History Museum) is showing boats instead of a museum"
- "Gallery MLK Memorial is showing the wrong image"
- "Day 3 (Harborfest) looks correct"

### Option 2: Review the Current Assignments

Below are all the current image assignments. Check the live site and tell me which ones are wrong:

## What I Need From You

Simply tell me:
1. Which section has the wrong image (e.g., "Day 6" or "Gallery MLK Memorial")
2. What it's currently showing (e.g., "boats" or "wrong monument")
3. What it should show (e.g., "American History Museum" or "MLK Memorial")

Or you can say:
- "Day X should use image Y instead"
- "Gallery Z is showing the wrong thing"

I'll then update the HTML to fix the assignments!
